### Cybersecurity Enthusiast: Threat Intelligence & Malware Analysis

Welcome to my digital realm, where I showcase my explorations and contributions in the vast world of cybersecurity. I am constantly tinkering, learning, and developing, and this space serves as a testament to my journey. Feel free to navigate through my repositories and tools. Feedback is invaluable; if you have any suggestions or insights, kindly raise an issue in the respective repository.

## Featured Tools

- **[zipSniper](https://github.com/michaelf97/zipSniper)**: A Rust application that remotely reads ZIP files to display their directory listing. It's especially handy when determining the value of downloading a ZIP archive over Tor given its often slow speeds.

- **[shellrunner](https://github.com/michaelf97/shellcode_injector)**: Simplifies the dynamic analysis of shellcode. This tool injects shellcode into a specified memory address, streamlining the process.

- **[32bit_a3x_converter](https://github.com/michaelf97/32bit_a3x_converter)**: Working with 64-bit AutoIT a3x compiled scripts? This tool is essential for converting them to 32-bit, ensuring compatibility with various tools.

- **[pwndar](https://github.com/michaelf97/pwndar)**: A Rust-based CLI tool to query the [HaveIBeenPwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). While it started as a personal exercise, it might be of use to others.

- **[godaddy_ddns](https://github.com/michaelf97/godaddy_ddns)**: A Python script tailored for those using Godaddy's DNS. Ideal when hosting resources behind ISP-provided routers with dynamic IPs, this program automatically updates the domain's A record every hour.
